# cocktails-menu-search
This project utilizes the CocktailDB API (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to extract cocktail data and display it on a web browser. It enables users to search for cocktails by their name, ID, and letters contained within their name.

## Description

- **Search by Name:** Users can search for a specific cocktail by entering its name. The application will fetch data from the API and display the corresponding cocktail information.

- **Search by ID:** Users can directly search for a cocktail using its unique ID. The application will retrieve the cocktail details associated with that ID from the API.
